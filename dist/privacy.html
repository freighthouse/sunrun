Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.</p>
            <h2>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES, DO NOT USE OUR WEBSITE.</h2>
            <p>By accessing or using this Website, you become subject to our Policy. This Policy may change from time to time however, the current version will be posted to the Website.

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of any material changes to the Policy through the Website, by sending you an email, or through other means.</p>
            <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>We will collect information directly from you by which you may be personally identified, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number and certain information about your home and home energy usage ("Personal Information") when you provide it to us on the Website.</p>
            <p>Additionally, as you navigate through and interact with our Website, we automatically collect certain passive information from you such as your IP address, browser type, system type, the content and pages that you access on Website, “referring URL” (i.e., the page from which you navigated to the Website), the pages you navigate to on the Website, and from which you leave the Website, as well as the time you spend on the Website. Certain information such as your city and country we derive from collecting you IP Address. Other information such as what kind of device you are visiting our Website on (i.e. mobile phone versus desktop computer), we derive from your browser type. We may also capture and store an HTML version of the page on the Website in which you submitted a request for information.</p>
            <p>We may obtain information about you from other sources, including commercially available sources, such as data aggregators and public databases, or social networks that you use to connect with us.

            <p>Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.<br>We use the non-personally identifiable information using Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to learn about what our users are interested in (on non-personally identifiable level) and to more effectively remarket to consumers.</p>
            <p>Google Adsense.<br>Many third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to this Website.
